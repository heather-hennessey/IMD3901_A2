# A-Frame Project

## Overview
I created a spray painting experience that allows the user to paint a wall with a random color. The spray paints are instantiated after clicking on the source object, and are destroyed when they hover over the garbage can object. To paint, simply click and drag around the wall. Gaze interaction is enabled for mobile usage, along with some tilt movement controls. I tried to include intuitive interactions that feel comfortable for the user.


## Challenges
Unfortunately time was a big challenge. I had planned to include a shake interaction using the gyroscope on mobile but did not have time to implement. I also explored painting dynamically on the wall canvas and came very close but had to move on to finish in time. I regret that I couldn't submit a fully finished product, however I did try to focus more on interaction than looks/model quality. 


## Successes
I really enjoyed the custom component system and explored the use of mixins which I believe worked well. I'm also feeling much more comfortable with Javascript now and will bring what I learned into our term project.
